This is a very quick-and-dirty first attempt at making the graphs Mark requested for the SB BBS.

# Data prep
```{r}
# Read in data
data_full <- read.csv("BBS_data.csv")
```

There are `r length(unique(data_full$Breeding.Evidence))` types of breeding evidence in the dataset. Mark said he's focusing on 15 of them in the following categories:

![](categories.png){width=40%}

In the code below, I group the evidence types in the dataset into those categories, labeled by the corresponding color in Mark's list, and then make a categorical variable for the five groups. I label these groups with the first name in Mark's list, so the group composed of "Carrying nest material" and "Nest building" is just called "Carrying nest material."

```{r}
# Get unique types of breeding evidence
breeding_evidence_cat <- unique(data_full$Breeding.Evidence)

# Select the 15 Mark is interested in
select_evidence_cat <- breeding_evidence_cat[c(11, 6, 22, 4, 13, 10, 3, 24, 1, 7, 9, 15, 27, 18, 20)]

# Group into the five categories
red_cat <- select_evidence_cat[c(1,2)]
blue_cat <- select_evidence_cat[c(3,4)]
black_cat <- select_evidence_cat[5:9]
green_cat <- select_evidence_cat[10:14]
orange_cat <- select_evidence_cat[15]

# Filter the dataset to only include observations with evidence in one of the 15 categories
data <- data_full %>% filter(Breeding.Evidence %in% select_evidence_cat)

# Make categorical variable
data$evidence_category <- rep(NA, nrow(data))
data$evidence_category[data$Breeding.Evidence %in% red_cat] <- "Carrying nest material"
data$evidence_category[data$Breeding.Evidence %in% blue_cat] <- "Copulation"
data$evidence_category[data$Breeding.Evidence %in% black_cat] <- "Carrying food"
data$evidence_category[data$Breeding.Evidence %in% green_cat] <- "Family group"
data$evidence_category[data$Breeding.Evidence %in% orange_cat] <- "Juv indep"
```

I also standardize the date format and make a new variable for week.

```{r}
# Standardize date format
data$Date <- dmy(data$Date)

# Make a new variable, week
data$week <- week(data$Date)
```

# Red-tailed Hawk

One of the graphs Mark asked for looks like this:

<center>

![Red-tailed Hawk graph](bbs_rth.png)

</center>

Here I filter observations only for Red-tailed Hawk, then summarize across week and group of evidence  (among 5 groups).

```{r}
cond_evidence_by_week <- data %>%
  filter(Common.Name == "Red-tailed Hawk") %>%
  group_by(week, evidence_category) %>%
  tally()
```

And then plot it. Each dot is the number of observations in a given week for a given type of evidence, across all years. The color denotes the evidence category.

```{r}
ggplot(cond_evidence_by_week, aes(x = week, y = n, color = evidence_category)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "red", "blue", "green", "orange")) +
  labs(title = "Red-tailed Hawk", x = "Week", y = "Count", color = "Type of evidence")
```
